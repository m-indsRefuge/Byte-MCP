# Changelog

All notable Byte-MCP changes are documented here.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-06

### Completed

- Froze the four-tool read-only MCP contract: `list_roots`, `list_directory`, `search`, and `fetch`.
- Enforced loopback-only Streamable HTTP runtime configuration.
- Added denied-operation and unexpected-error auditing.
- Replaced raw audit storage of queries and opaque references with SHA-256 fingerprints and lengths.
- Added repeatable MCP discovery and search/fetch smoke testing.
- Added Windows and Ubuntu GitHub Actions validation.
- Expanded security, service, and settings tests to 14 passing tests.
- Validated the accepted implementation through local Gates A-F.
- Validated a restricted local remote-integration profile exposing only the `share` root.
- Recorded remote ChatGPT deployment as an external dependency rather than unfinished Byte-MCP implementation.
- Added closeout, freeze, and remote-integration resumption documentation.
